And also dangerous. But exciting! And also horrible because I caused myself a lot of trouble and barfed on my keyboard. (Metaphorically.) Oops.\r\n\r\nMy hope for this talk is to pass along lessons I learned the hard way, and save the world. Or at least prevent some frustration. :) \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll talk about:\r\n\r\n- version control\r\n- structuring your project\r\n- and how to handle top secret stuff. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll also talk about: \r\n\r\n- throwing house parties without causing anaphylaxis\r\n- pregnant daddy seahorses\r\n- velociraptors \r\n- and friends. \r\n\r\nI promise all of that is related to Django.",
