CPU bound vs IO bound processes.\r\n* Concurrency is not the same as multithreading\r\n* Single threaded concurrency\r\n\r\n# Generators - already in Python 2 !\r\n\r\n* Generator - a function you can pause!\r\n* How to implement async with generators and event loop in Python 2\r\n* Real working code - a Python version of the JavaScript setTimeout function\r\n\r\n# What is new in Python 3 ?\r\n\r\n* async/await - really generators in disguise!\r\n* asyncio library - ready made event loop and IO functions\r\n* new syntax and new library are independent - you can mix and match old and new!",
